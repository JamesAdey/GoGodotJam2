# GoGodotJam2
Play it here! https://vulcanstorm.itch.io/powernetworks

This is the source code for my GoGodotJam2 submission, Power Networks.

The game code is almost all written in C++, this includes the AI and gameplay systems.
GDScript was used for the UI to keep it simple (and due to jam time constraints!).
